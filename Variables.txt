Variables are used to store and label pieces
of information. You'll use them a lot in your 
code - for example, to hold your current score
or keep track of how many lives you have left.

^Storage Box
A variable is like a boc with a name label.
You can store data in the box and then use
its name to find the data again when you 
need to use it.
                                    CH-2 HOW TO CREATE A VARIABLE

You need to give each variarble a name that describes 
what data is stored inside it. What the variable stores is 
called its value. Type the name followed byan equals
sign, then type the value, with a space between each
part. This is called "assigning a value" to the variable.

                                    CH-3 NAMING VARIABLES

Always choose a meaningful name
for each variable in your programs.
For example, a variable for tracking the
number of attempts a player has left
could be called 'attemts_remaining',
rather than just 'attempts' or 'a'. Variable
names can contain letters, numbers, and
underscores, but they should allways start
with a letter. Follow these rules and you 
wont go wrong.

                                    CH-4 DO'S AND DONT'S (FOR NAMING VARIABLES)
                                
*Always start the variables name with a letter.

*Any letter or number can be used in the name.

*Symbols such as -,/,#,@ aren't allowed.

*Do not use spaces. An underscore (_) can be used instead.

*Upercase(capital) and lowercase letters are different.
 Python will treat 'Score' and 'score' as two different variables.

*Avoid words that are used in Python as commands,
 such as "function" or "screen".
