Variables are used to store and label pieces
of information. You'll use them a lot in your 
code - for example, to hold your current score
or keep track of how many lives you have left.

^Storage Box
A variable is like a boc with a name label.
You can store data in the box and then use
its name to find the data again when you 
need to use it.
                                    CH-2 HOW TO CREATE A VARIABLE

You need to give each variarble a name that describes 
what data is stored inside it. What the variable stores is 
called its value. Type the name followed byan equals
sign, then type the value, with a space between each
part. This is called "assigning a value" to the variable.
